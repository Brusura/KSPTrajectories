- auto-pilot UI next to the navball (both in flight view and map view)
- disengage auto-pilot when touching an input, or enabling SAS
- smooth avoidance of mountains
- add guidance and auto-pilot for aerobraking (specify desired Pe either from current trajectory or in a text box)
- detect auto-pilot failures (can't steer as needed, or can't correct the trajectory to reach the target)
- display auto-pilot status (On track, Correcting, Avoiding mountain, Can't steer, Can't correct trajectory)
- test auto-pilot on capsules (prograde and retrograde)
- move auto-pilot feature in a module, as a separate part, add in research tree for career mode (or embed in probe cores of high-enough tech-level)
